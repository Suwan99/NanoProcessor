# NanoProcessor
Assigned Lab Task
In this lab we are supposed to design a simple 4-bit microprocessor which is capable to execute
4 instructions. The four instructions that we should run in this microprocessor are

● moving a value to a register 
● adding, or subtracting two values
● taking the two’s complement of a given value
● finally, the jump instruction.


To develop this, we had to take sub-components wired and connected using buses and build
the main component. We used 3, 4 and 12-bit busses. Identification of the role of inputs and
outputs also an important task that we were supposed to do. The subcomponents that we used
here were 3-bit adder which is use full when increment the program counter , few k way m bit
multiplexers a 2-way 3-bit multiplexer , a 2-way 4-bit multiplexer and 8-way 4-bit multiplexer.
Next, we have to build the register bank which consists of seven 4-bit registers and then the
Program ROM to store our program. Next, we took the instruction decoder.
After completing and implementing all these sub-components we developed the nano
processor by connecting each of them.
Finally we were supposed to check and observe the functionality using Basys 3 board.
